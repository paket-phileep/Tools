upload files to github repos / gist or npm 


gists can have the hit url and the document it has found 

repos can have information on the scans

npm has a large limit i suppose this can store the recipts of the urls scanned we can use jsdeliver for this 


using js deliver can show the econtents of a npm or repo 


users should be able to discard paths they dont like 
like samsung/......
